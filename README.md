1) 
Compression ratio:
Alice and Wonderland: 156/168=92%
Poetry-Edgar Allen Poe: 62/64=94%


Entropy: 
Alice and Wonderland: 3.217687929229665
Poetry-Edgar Allen Poe: 3.2100657597786904

It appears to not be compressing that effectively. 


2) 
Random.org 
Compression ratio: 
Entropy: 5.545043246556351

3) Data that is less random might compress better, because with random data it'll take way longer to find long matches.

4) 
Entropy of compressed A&W: 4.6574505177624
Entropy of compressed Poetry: 4.641521924179349
