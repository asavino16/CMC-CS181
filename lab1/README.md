lab1.txt file
entropy: 3.1518379232169402

otherfile.txt
entropy: 3.045319085905326

random.txt: 5.545176010585699

When comparing the entropy's of the lab1.txt file, otherfile.txt which is a small essay that I wrote, and random.txt which was a randomly generated file, it makes sense that the random one had the highest entropy. My file had the lowest entropy which is also predictable since I probably repeated certain words and characters more often.
